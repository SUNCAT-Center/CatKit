** Using the cathub command line interface

Run =cathub=, like so

-  =cathub --help=

or with any of its sub-commands, like so

-  =cathub make_folders_template project1.json --create-template=

To create a folder structure from a .json input file

-  =cathub make_folders_template project1.json=

To convert a folder containing adsorption energy calculations into a
a folder structure suitable for catalysis-hub.org submission
 (will not change existing files and create a new folder with suffix .organized)

- =cathub organize <folder-name> --adsorbates O,OH,OOH=

This is aimed for single-adsorbate reaction energies. Structure are matched
base on unit cell and chemical formula. Consult for more options

- =cathub organize --help=

Querying the Catalysis Hub database:

-  =cathub reactions -q reactants=CO -q chemicalComposition=~Pt=

-  =cathub publications -q title=~Evolution -q year=2017=

Reading folders into sqlite3 db file:

-  =cathub folder2db <foldername>=

Sending the data to the Catalysis Hub server:

-  =cathub db2server <dbfile>=
